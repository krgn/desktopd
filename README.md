# desktopd

`desktopd` integrates [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and Firefox via an extension to provide the ability to navigate transparently between browser tabs and regular windows. 

## TODO

* nixpkgs + systemd files
* moving tabs should be tracked properly
* custom alacritty-based launcher
* assign-like functionality
* config file
